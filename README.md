# sdl2pp_imgui_template

A template for quickly building applications with [libSDL2pp](https://github.com/libSDL2pp/libSDL2pp) and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

- SDL2's renderer and the matching ImGui backends are used
- Setup code and main loop are already implemented, see `sources/application.cpp`
- A demo is included, see `sources/demo_application.cpp`
- Both libraries are bundled into the target executable
